### New feature: Price history per store
- Define stores under master data
- New product option to set the default store
- Track on purchase/inventory in which store you bought the product (gets prefilled by the last store you purchased the product, or the default store of the product if you never bought it)
- => The price history chart on the product card shows a line per store
- (Thanks @immae and @kriddles)
