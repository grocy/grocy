### New feature: xxxx

### Stock

- Added a new product picker workflow "External barcode lookup (via plugin)"
  - This executes the configured barcode lookup plugin with the given barcode
  - If the lookup was successful, the product edit page of the created product is displayed, where the product setup can be completed (if required)
  - After that, the transaction is continued with that product
- Fixed that when copying a product, the field "Treat opened as out of stock" wasn't copied along (thanks @TheDodger)
