### Stock

- Fixed that the built-in Open Food Facts external barcode lookup plugin used the staging environment of the Open Food Facts API instead of the production one
- Fixed that the product group filter on the products page (master data) didn't work when the selected product group contained special characters
- Fixed that the product filter on the stock journal summary page didn't work when the selected product contained special characters

### Shopping list

- Optimized that non-number amounts are now prevented on database level (was infamously a problem when using specific community contributed alternative clients)

### Tasks

- Fixed that set table filters were not applied after editing or adding a task

### Userfields

- Fixed that saving Userfields of type "Select list (multiple items can be selected)" did not work

### General

- Optimized that when navigating between form input fields via the keyboard (`TAB`) there was an unwanted delay at some places
