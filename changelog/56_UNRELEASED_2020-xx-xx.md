- Optimized the new compact view (there was a little too much white space at the sides of the page)
- Added an option to not switch to the new compact view on mobile devices automatically (in the shopping list settings / top right corner settings menu) (defaults to `false`, so no changed behavior when not configured) (thanks @Forceu)

- When adding a recipe, the serving amount is now prefilled with the one of the selected recipe (thanks @kriddles)
- Fixed that the meal plan not used the full height on mobile devices

- Fixed that the calendar not used the full height on mobile devices

### General & other improvements/fixes
