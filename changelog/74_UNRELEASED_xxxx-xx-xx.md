### New feature: xxxx

### Stock

- Added a new product picker workflow "External barcode lookup (via plugin)"
  - This executes the configured barcode lookup plugin with the given barcode
  - If the lookup was successful, the product edit page of the created product is displayed, where the product setup can be completed (if required)
  - After that, the transaction is continued with that product
- Fixed that the location dropdown on the consume page contained the same location multiple times if there are currently stock entries at multiple locations of the corresponding product
- Fixed that the status filter "n products are overdue" on the stock overview page also counted/included stock entries due today or tomorrow
