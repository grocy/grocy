### New feature: grocycode / label printer support
#### (Own) Product/stock entry/chores/batteries labels/barcodes
- Print own labels/barcodes for products/stock entries/chores/batteries and then scan that code on every place a product/stock entry/chore/battery can be selected
- Can be printed (or downloaded) via
  - The product/chore/battery edit page
  - The context/more menu per line on the overview pages and for stock entries on the stock entries page
  - Automatically on purchase (new option on the purchase page, defaults can be configured per product) for stock entries
- The used barcode type can be configured via the `config.php` option `GROCYCODE_TYPE`:
  - `1D` (default) will produce a `Code128` 1D barcode (supported by the integrated camera barcode scanner)
  - `2D` will produce a `DataMatrix` 2D barcode (currently not supported by the integrated camera barcode scanner, but can be probably printed smaller)
- Label printer functionality can be enabled via the new feature flag `FEATURE_FLAG_LABEL_PRINTER` (defaults to disabled)
- Label printer communication happens via WebHooks - see the new `LABEL_PRINTER*` `config.php` options
- grocycodes can also be used without a label printer - you can view or download thm as pictures and print them manually

### New feature: Shopping list thermal printer support
- The shopping list can now be printed on a thermal printer

  - See the new `TPRINTER*` `config.php` options to configure the printer connection and other options

  - This happens automatically on consuming a recipe/product from the meal plan page
- It's now possible to copy all entries of a day to another day (in the dropdown of the add button in the header of each day column)
- The "Display recipe" button was removed, instead clicking the recipe title now displays the recipe (and this now also works for products; shows the product card)
- Fixed that stock fulfillment checking used the desired servings of the recipe (those selected on the recipes page, not them from the meal plan entry)

### Chores improvements/fixes
- It's now possible to track any addtional info on a chore execution by using Userfields
  - => Configure the desired Userfields for the entity `chores_log`
  - => The on chore execution tracking entered information is then visible on the corresponding chore journal entry

- Fixed that the number picker up/down buttons did not work when the input field was empty or contained an invalid number
- Fixed that links and embeds (e.g. YouTube videos) did not work in the text editor
- Fixed that the "Manage users" and "Manage API keys" menu was not shown when using reverse proxy authentication

### API improvements/fixes
> ~~❗ Numbers are now returned as numbers (so technically without quotes around them, were strings for nearly all endpoints before - should practically be no real difference)~~
>
> => ❗❗❗ This has been reverted after this (v3.1.0) release since it had unintended side effects
- Added a new endpoint `/system/localization-strings` to get the localization strings (gettext JSON representation; in the by the user desired language)
- Added a new endpoint `/recipes/{recipeId}/copy` to copy a recipe
- The `GET /chores` endpoint now also returns the `next_execution_assigned_user` object per chore (like the endpoint `GET /chores​/{choreId}` already did for a single chore)
- The `GET /tasks` endpoint now also returns the assigned user and category object per task
- Empty Userfields are now also returned (were previously omitted, endpoint `GET /objects/{entity}` and `GET /objects/{entity}/{objectId}`)
- Fixed that due soon products with `due_type` = "Expiration date" were missing in `due_products` of the `/stock/volatile` endpoint
- Fixed that `PUT/DELETE /objects/{entity}/{objectId}` produced an internal server error when the given object id was invalid (now returns `400 Bad Request`)
- Fixed that hyphens in filter values did not work
- Fixed that cyrillic letters were not allowed in filter values
