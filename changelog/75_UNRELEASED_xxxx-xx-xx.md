### New feature: xxxx

### Stock

- Added a new product picker workflow "External barcode lookup (via plugin)"
  - This executes the configured barcode lookup plugin with the given barcode
  - If the lookup was successful, the product edit page of the created product is displayed, where the product setup can be completed (if required)
  - After that, the transaction is continued with that product
- When using/scanning a stock entry Grocycode on the transfer page, the "Use specific stock item" dropdown (and "From location") is now also prefilled accordingly
- Fixed that for the product's last price stock transactions with an empty or `0` price weren't ignored
- Fixed that when copying a product, the field "Move on open" wasn't copied along

### Shopping list
